# VerbaCompareScraper

While taking some courses online, I realized that keeping an eye on which books are used in other classes could give me a heads-up as to what to order for later classes, or just good reading material. The school I am attending uses verbacompare.com to list courses & books, however itâ€™s UI is less than friendly to getting the info I wanted, so I wrote a very simple scraper to pull the info on all the courses (or just the areas I want) and dump it to the console.
